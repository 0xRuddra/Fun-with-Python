# E.D.I.T.H - Your AI Desktop Assistant

E.D.I.T.H (Even Dead, I'm The Hero) is an advanced AI Desktop Assistant built with Python and powered by OpenAI. This program is designed to improve human-like interactions by providing a conversational experience similar to speaking with a real person. It springs into action when you say "wake up EDI" or "wake up Friday".

## Key Features

1. **Various Modes**: E.D.I.T.H operates in four different modes â€” `Internet Mode`, `Assistant Mode`, `Hacking Mode`, and `Help Mode`. You can switch between these modes by simply commanding "Friday, go to Internet mode" or "go to Assistant mode", and so forth.

2. **Human-like Interaction**: E.D.I.T.H can chat with you just like a human, enhancing the user experience.

3. **Chat Management**: If you want to clear the conversation, you just have to command 'clear the chat'. To quit or close the program, say 'go to sleep Friday/EDI', which prompts the program to exit.

## Modes Overview

1. **Internet Mode**: Go to your favorite websites just by instructing "Friday, open Google" or "open Facebook."

2. **Assistant Mode**: Open any desktop application with a command like "Friday, open Telegram", "open Zoom", "open Opera".

3. **Hacking Mode**: Stay updated with the upcoming cybersecurity events by asking "Friday, show me the upcoming CTF events."

4. **Help Mode**: You can ask for any help, such as "write me an email," and E.D.I.T.H will get it done for you.
